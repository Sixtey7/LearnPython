# LearnPython
Simple repo used to push stuff up as I work through a fairly basic book on learning Python

Trying to do one chapter a day and then use this repo to store the things to do from the end of the chapter.

Also using this to get familiar with Django. 

# Book
The book I'm following is [Introducing Python by Bill Lubanovic](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python/9781449361167/)

# Django
The tutorial I'm following is [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/)
