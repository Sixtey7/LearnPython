# LearnPython
Simple repo used to push stuff up as I work through a fairly basic book on learning Python

Trying to do one chapter a day and work through the exercises in this repo

# Book
The book I'm following is [Introducing Python by Bill Lubanovic](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python/9781449361167/)
